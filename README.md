# Todo-App
Access the App: http://dazzling-lamington-cd638b.netlify.app/

A simple and interactive Todo List web application that allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks. This project demonstrates essential JavaScript DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage usage.

# Features
Add new tasks to the list

Mark tasks as completed by checking the checkbox

Unmark tasks to mark them as not completed

Delete tasks from the list

Persist tasks and their completion status using browser local storage

Dynamic UI updates reflecting current tasks and their states

Counts and displays the number of remaining (incomplete) tasks

# How It Works
User enters a task and clicks the "Add" button to create a new todo item.

Each todo item is added to the list with a checkbox, text, and a delete button.

Checking the checkbox marks the task as completed and updates its style.

Unchecking the checkbox reverts the task to incomplete.

Clicking the delete button removes the todo from the list.

The app saves all todos and their completion states in local storage, so the list persists on page reload.

The app dynamically updates event listeners for checkboxes and delete buttons whenever the todos list changes.
